# Russell 2000 Earnings Surprise Options Strategy

A comprehensive quantitative trading strategy for QuantConnect that targets Russell 2000 stocks with the biggest earnings surprises and implements sophisticated options strategies with dynamic risk management.

## Strategy Overview

This algorithm implements a multi-component trading strategy:

1. **Universe Selection**: Russell 2000 stocks via IWM ETF constituents
2. **Earnings Screening**: Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE) to identify top 5% performers
3. **Options Strategies**: Short vertical spreads and broken wing butterflies
4. **Risk Management**: Comprehensive portfolio and position-level risk controls
5. **Dynamic Management**: Automatic adjustments for upside moves and changing conditions

## Files Structure

### Core Strategy Files
- `integrated_strategy.py` - Main algorithm integrating all components
- `russell_2000_earnings_options_strategy.py` - Original standalone implementation

### Component Modules
- `earnings_screener.py` - SUE calculation and earnings surprise screening
- `options_manager.py` - Options strategy implementation and management
- `risk_manager.py` - Comprehensive risk management system

## Key Features

### Earnings Surprise Screening (SUE)
- **Formula**: `SUE = (EPS_current - EPS_4quarters_ago) / Ïƒ(EPS_changes)`
- Tracks quarterly earnings data with 8-quarter lookback
- Ranks stocks by SUE score and selects top 5%
- Filters for quality and liquidity requirements

### Options Strategies

#### Short Vertical Spreads (Bear Call Spreads)
- **Use Case**: High SUE scores with elevated implied volatility
- **Structure**: Sell ATM call, buy OTM call
- **Profit**: Premium collected from time decay
- **Risk**: Limited to strike width minus premium

#### Broken Wing Butterfly Spreads
- **Use Case**: Moderate to high SUE scores
- **Structure**: Asymmetric butterfly with upside bias
- **Profit**: Benefits from limited stock movement with upside potential
- **Risk**: Limited maximum loss with defined profit zones

### Risk Management

#### Portfolio Level
- Maximum 20% portfolio at risk
- Maximum 5% risk per position  
- Maximum 30% sector concentration
- Daily loss limits (3%) and drawdown limits (15%)

#### Position Level
- Greeks monitoring (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta)
- Correlation risk assessment
- Volatility-based position sizing
- Emergency stop mechanisms

#### Dynamic Management
- 50% profit targets
- 25% stop losses
- Time decay management (close 7 days before expiration)
- Upside move adjustments (>10% underlying moves)

## Usage Instructions

### For QuantConnect Platform

1. **Upload Files**: Upload all Python files to your QuantConnect algorithm folder

2. **Main Algorithm**: Use `integrated_strategy.py` as your main algorithm file

3. **Configuration**: Adjust parameters in the `initialize()` method:
   ```python
   self.max_positions = 20          # Maximum concurrent positions
   self.top_percentage = 0.05       # Top 5% by SUE score
   self.max_portfolio_risk = 0.20   # 20% max portfolio risk
   ```

4. **Backtest Period**: Default 2022-2024, adjust as needed:
   ```python
   self.set_start_date(2022, 1, 1)
   self.set_end_date(2024, 12, 31)
   ```

5. **Capital**: Default $1M, adjust based on your account:
   ```python
   self.set_cash(1000000)
   ```

### Strategy Parameters

#### Earnings Screening
- `lookback_quarters = 8` - Historical earnings data periods
- `min_sue_score = 0.5` - Minimum SUE threshold
- `earnings_lookback_quarters = 8` - Quarters for SUE calculation

#### Options Selection
- `days_to_expiration_min = 30` - Minimum DTE
- `days_to_expiration_max = 60` - Maximum DTE
- `target_dte = 45` - Target days to expiration
- `target_delta = 0.20` - Target delta for short strikes

#### Risk Controls
- `max_portfolio_risk = 0.20` - Maximum portfolio risk
- `max_position_risk = 0.05` - Maximum per position risk
- `profit_target = 0.50` - Close at 50% profit
- `stop_loss_threshold = 0.25` - Stop loss at 25% of max risk

- **High SUE (>2.0) + Low IV**: Broken Wing Butterfly
- **Moderate SUE (1-2)**: Short Vertical Spreads
- **Lower SUE (<1)**: Broken Wing Butterfly

## Performance Expectations

### Target Metrics

## Customization Options

### Modify Universe Size
```python
# In _etf_filter method
return [c.symbol for c in sorted_constituents[:1000]]  # Increase from 500
```

### Adjust SUE Selection
```python
# In _fundamental_filter method
self.top_percentage = 0.03  # Top 3% instead of 5%
min_sue_score = 1.0         # Higher SUE threshold
```

### Change Options Strategy Mix
```python
# In evaluate_strategy_for_symbol method
if sue_score > 1.5:  # Lower threshold for verticals
    return StrategyType.SHORT_VERTICAL
```

### Modify Risk Parameters
```python
# In RiskManager initialization
self.max_portfolio_risk = 0.15      # More conservative
self.profit_target = 0.40           # Earlier profit taking
self.stop_loss_threshold = 0.20     # Tighter stops
```
